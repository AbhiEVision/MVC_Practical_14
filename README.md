# MVC_Practical_14

here we used data base first approch so we have to make date base first.

here i attached a SQL file which contains the database creation queries.

first open than file inside a sql server management studio and run that file.

after that open project with visual studio.

after that change the connection string according to your pc.

now you are good to go.

if you got the same error as before of roslyn than you have to run the below command inside a package manager console

<strong> Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r </strong>
